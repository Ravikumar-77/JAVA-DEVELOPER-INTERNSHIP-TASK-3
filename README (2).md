## 📘 Student Result Processing System (Java)

## 📌 Project Title
Control Flow Based Student Result System

## 📖 Description

This is a console-based Java application developed as part of Java Developer Internship – Task 3.
The program processes student results by accepting marks, validating input, calculating percentage, and assigning grades using control flow statements.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

Primary: IntelliJ IDEA
Alternative: Eclipse / VS Code
Language: Java

## 🎯 Features

- Accepts marks for multiple subjects
- Validates marks range (0–100)
- Calculates total marks and percentage
- Assigns grades using if-else and switch
- Allows multiple student entries using loops
- Uses break and continue for control flow
- Modular design using reusable methods
- Clean and readable code structure

## 🔁 Control Flow Concepts Used

- if-else for input validation
- switch-case for grade calculation
- for loop for subject marks input
- while loop for multiple students
- break to exit program
- continue to re-enter invalid marks

## 🧠 Grade Criteria
Percentage	Grade
90 – 100	A+
80 – 89  	A
70 – 79	    B
60 – 69	    C
50 – 59	    D
< 50	Fail

## ▶️ How to Run

- Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
- Create a Java file named:
StudentResultSystem.java
- Copy the source code into the file
- Compile and run the program
- Enter marks as prompted in the console

## 🧪 Sample Output
--- Student Result Processing System ---
Enter number of subjects: 3
Enter marks for subject 1: 85
Enter marks for subject 2: 78
Enter marks for subject 3: 90

--- Result Summary ---
Total Marks: 253
Percentage: 84.33%
Grade: A

Do you want to enter another student? (yes/no): no
